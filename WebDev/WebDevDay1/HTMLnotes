------------Tags------------

<p>                 opening tag
Hello, world!       data
</p>                closing tag

This is a paragraph

Can also have self closing Tags

<input>             This is self closing so no end tag. Can also be written as <input/> - this is the old way of doing it though. 
This is a text box.

------------Attributes------------
<input type = "text">
<input type = "password">
<input type = "number">

The types are the attributes and they tell you about the tag.

------------Webpage structure------------
<html>
    <head>
        data ab out the page - metadata
    </head>
    <body>
        content
    </body>
<html>

---------- Document Object Model ----------
Is basically the webpage in a tree structure
                html
        /                   \
    head                    body
    |     \               |    |      \
meta    title            p   input   image


---------- Semantic elements ----------

To divide webpage you use the <div> tag.
div - divider --> groups elements together
div doesn't get rendered on the page, it just allows you to group things together which is useful for styling. 
This changes how the DOM would look

                html
        /                   \
    head                    body
    |     \               |    |     
meta    title            p      div
                              /     \
                            input   image 

In HTML5 there are new dividers
main
section
article
header
footer
navigation bar
aside (a side bar)

Will not see a difference when using these - but why have them?

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)--> how you get a search engine to notice you!
Properly structured webpages are more likely to be prioritised by search engines. 
Also a legal requirement for this -> Accessibility. 
            If someone has a disability and needs to use a screen reader, the screen reader works much better with these dividers.

So.. no harder to use than a normal div, but makes website more accessible for disabled users and increases SEO. 

---------- Headings ----------
h1 -- big
h2
h3
h4 -- regular text size
h5
h6 -- small

---------- Text decoration ----------

---------- Hyperlinks ----------
These are put in anchor tags 
<a href="www.kfmsnkdfbjvisjdnv.com">
    Home
</a>
Can hyperlink to something in the same folder using ./ -- makes it more explicit
../ means up one folder

---------- Lists ----------
Two types, ordered and unordered
<ol></ol> - tag for an ordered list --> will be numbered
<ul></ul> - tag for an unordered list --> wont be numbered
Each list element is marked with <li></li>

A dropdown is done using <select></select>
Each element marked with <option></option>
or <option value="KD"> Katherine Louise Diggory </option> - this shortens the value that you refer to later on rather than using the fill dropdown option. Easier for coding in JS. 

Can also group the options! <optgroup></optgroup>


---------- Images ----------

<img id = "picId" src=" " alt="Text that shows if pic doesnt load">
The id is how you can refer to a specific element -> so can integrate with CSS and JS

---------- Forms ----------

For submitting data
<form action="mystery">
<label for>Username</label>
<input type = "text" name = "" id="" >
<label for>Password</label>
<input type = "text" name = "" id="" >
