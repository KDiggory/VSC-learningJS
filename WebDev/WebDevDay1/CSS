CSS - cascading style sheet

There are 520 distinct properties you can set in CSS!! Wont go through all but once you know how to apply them you can work it all out. 

-------- In line --------

In line styling - adding the style attribute to a tag
<tag style = " ">
Easiest type of styling but have to be careful when using it, its not the best way to do things!
It is good for styling an individual element, but can be hard to over write. 

-------- Internal styling --------

<style>
h1 {font-size:15pt;font-weight:bold}
 p {font:bolditalic 12pt/20pt Times,serif} 
</style>
But this only styles that particular page

-------- External styling --------
Write an external CSS file, then you import this into your page

If have 2 imported files, the one you imported second will override things that are set in both. 

-------- Selectors --------
Selectors are how you apply different properties.
Specificity - the more specific selector wins! Eg if you say all text is purple, and h1 text is pink, then the h1 text will be pink and the rest purple.

tag = least specific selector
class = mediumly specific selector --> is an attribute used to group elements together. 
id = most specific selector.
// Nothing beats an id selector - except inline styling, as that overrides everything! A reason why we don't tend to use this. 

Class - if you want to style h1 and h2 the same for example, you would set them as the same class. In the css sheet these are referred to as .className

To reference an id you use a #
#idName

id > class > tag

Can make them more specific by combining more things
eg h1.className is more specific than .className

** Can make things a different colour when you hover over it!
a:hover {
    
}
